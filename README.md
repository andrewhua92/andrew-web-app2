# Web App - The Sequel
This is my second React web app, this time created from scratch without CRA. Designed with styled-components, Material-UI, packaged with Webpack and Babel, and uses React-Router for pages.

Page is hosted here with Github Pages: https://andrewhua92.github.io/andrew-web-app2/

Planning to move to a personal domain in the future.
